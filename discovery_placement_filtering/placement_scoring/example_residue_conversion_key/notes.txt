The purpose of this file is to allow for being able to convert residue indices in identified motifs from a Rosetta placed ligand PDB.
It is possible that Rosetta gets different indexing for the residues in the generated PDB and the residues identified in motifs.
This file serves as a means to convert from the the motif indexing to the pdb indexing.
The example file was created by hand, converting residue indices from HCRTR2 PDB 4S0V to 7L1U.

A script to automatically translate all residues could be made at some point if the need arose.

The format of the residue index conversion key is as follows:

Each line contains 4 entries with entries 2 and 3 being the most important and actually used.
Entry 4 can technically be ignored

Header line:
residue type,source name,target name,change in index position
