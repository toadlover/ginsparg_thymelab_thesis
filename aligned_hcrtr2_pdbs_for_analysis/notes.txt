Methodology:

11 HCRTR2 PDB files taken from RCSB. 7 antagonist and 4 agonist.

Antagonist:
4s0v, 6tpg, 6tpj, 7xrr, 5ws3, 5wqc, 6tpn

Agonist
7l1v, 7sr8, 7sqo, 7l1u

Aligned all structures against 4s0v PDB using pymol align function
Exported aligned chain to new pdb file

Selected all residues within 7 angstroms of 4s0v suvorexant to investigate RMSD difference of binding pocket residues across systems
