Example command, calling conformator from working location:
./conformator -i ligand.sdf -o confs.sdf --keep3d --hydrogens -n 15 -v 0

Flags used:
-i - name of input ligand file (with path if necessary)
-o - name of output file with all conformers of initial ligand (with path if necessary)
--keep3d - keep 3d representation of conformers
--hydrogens - add/keep hydrogens for generated conformers
-n - maximum number of conformers to keep; having up to 15 conformers generally promotes diversity without oversaturating conformer amount
-v - verbosity, set to zero to improve runtime by eliminating all messaging
