Pockets were determined by utilizing the ProteinGrid sub area functionality in Rosetta to create voxelized areas around select regions around HCRTR2 with Ox in it.

We are looking at 2 main pockets, and a large pocket that encompasses the first 2, all located at the top of the pocket to attempt to identify ligands that could stabilize holding Ox in the HCRTR2 pocket.

Pocket 1 is surrounded by notable residues like Receptor GLU118 and ARG339 and Ligand ALA23.
Pocket 2 is surrounded by notable residues like Receptor LYS327, ARG328, and ASP211 and Ligand ILE25.

Pocket cavities are leveraged by having Rosetta print the entire protein grid, and then using grep to only select exmpty space, which is represented by oxygen atoms.

From there, the cavity is shifted to be in line with other shapedb inputs (empa_shifted.mol2 is used as the reference), and then the cavity is converted into mol2 and sdf formats so that shapedb can use the cavity.
