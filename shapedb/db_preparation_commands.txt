#Initial setup of conformers to be aligned using align.py script
#all conformers to be found in single file (example named confs_named.sdf; these files are uniquely named by their ligand and conformer number in the sdf data)
#In example, aligned molecules are written to file named aligned.sdf
#run with python
python ../align.py confs_named.sdf aligned.sdf

#Usage for shapedb to create a database of aligned molecules for usage in later shape similarity comparisons
# -h flag allows hydrogens to be kept in creating database
# -Create flag indicates making a molecular shape index
# -in indicates the name of the input file (aligned conformers in aligned.sdf)
# -db indicates the name of the output database file that can be used for shape comparison
/pharmit/src/build/shapedb -h -Create -in aligned.sdf -db db.db
