#Command to call shapedb's NNsearch command to compare target shape against a database of aligned ligands
# -NNSearch flag indicates to use shapedb's nnsearch
# -k flag indicates the number of nearest neighbors to return by shape similarity; ideally have k = total number of conformers in aligned database so that we return information on all conformers
# -ligand indicates target ligand file that is used to compare against all ligands in the database; this ligand must be aligned with the rest of the aligned.sdf file ahead of this command
# -db command indicates which shapedb database to use against target ligand
# -print indicates to write out the nearest neighbors to output stream
# The written NNSearch results can be piped into a text file for further processing
